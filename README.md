# Overview

Aim of the project is to monitor product prices on retail stores webpages in order to being able to quickly catch best deals and price fluctuations. Still in progress, currently only one category (laptops) from single store (euro.com.pl) is available, potentially can be expanded to include other categories and more stores, as well as adding more functionalities to the project.
