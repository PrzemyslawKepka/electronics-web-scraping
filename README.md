# Overview
Aim of the project is to monitor product prices on retail stores webpages in order to being able to quickly catch best deals and price fluctuations. Still in progress, currently only one category (laptops) from single store (euro.com.pl) is available, potentially can be expanded to include other categories and more stores, as well as adding more functionalities to the project.

### Update
As an expansion of the project, an app in `Streamlit` was created, allowing to browse products that had prices changes during Black Friday and Cyber Monday in 2021. Source file is available in the repository, so app can be run locally (after cloning the repo) using command `streamlit run st_app.py` in Command Prompt.
